Commands run:

- npx create-expo-app@latest --example with-router ./
<!-- (expo font for custom fonts, axios for data fetching as usual, and react-native-dotenv allows us to work with environment variables (does this mean that we can't work with environment variables without this?)) -->
- npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv
- npm install -g expo-cli
- expo-cli start --tunnel // shouldn't do this because expo cli comes with the project now. REFER TO: https://blog.expo.dev/the-new-expo-cli-f4250d8e3421. RUN npx expo start || npm start
- The package @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0 is required to use tunnels, would you like to install it globally?

<!-- REMINDERS -->

- div does not exist in react-native, remember this when you use rafce
- onclick is onpress for rn
- for target blank hrefs, you use Linking.openUrl(url) and for routes within, you use router.push(route)
- in onchange functions in rn, you immediately get the value of the change event ; instead of (e) => e.target.value, it becomes (value) => value
- onchange function doesn't exist in react native, it's onchangetext
- router.push takes you to a new page
- read on usecallback function react again

<!-- DOCUMENTATION FOR ERRORS ENCOUNTERED SO FAR AND HOW THEY WERE FIXED -->

a. Unmatched route : Fix - Didn't have a default export on homepage. // You removed react-native-unimodules.
b. Error while updating property showVerticalScrollIndicator : You put the value (false/true) in strings instead of boolean.
c. uri can't cast : you used src instead of src
d. renderItem (most occured in) forgetting to destructure, passing a value like a normal function {({})=>()} remember
