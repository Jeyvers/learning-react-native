Commands run:

- npx create-expo-app@latest --example with-router ./
<!-- (expo font for custom fonts, axios for data fetching as usual, and react-native-dotenv allows us to work with environment variables (does this mean that we can't work with environment variables without this?)) -->
- npm install expo-font axios react-native-dotenv
- npm install -g expo-cli
- expo-cli start --tunnel // shouldn't do this because expo cli comes with the project now. REFER TO: https://blog.expo.dev/the-new-expo-cli-f4250d8e3421. RUN npx expo start || npm start
- The package @expo/ngrok@^4.1.0 is required to use tunnels, would you like to install it globally?

### GENERAL NOTES

<!-- GENERAL NOTES -->

- React Native is a tool for developing mobile applications for both ios and android.
- Expo is a local development server for building, bundling, and compiling applications.
- React Native uses Native components instead of HTML tags (View replaces Divs, Text replaces P tags, Touchable Opacity replaces Buttons, and so on).
- View uses FlexBox layout by default. Interactive components such as buttons anchor tags are created using a component call Touchable Opacity which gives more room for customization and flexibility.
- Activity Indicator is the component for spinners or loading indicators.
- Stack: a layout component that makes it easy to stack elements together and apply a space between them.
- HeaderLeft & HeaderRight are used to create button on the left and right of the header.
- ScrollView, SafeAreaView, and FlatList.

### REMINDERS

<!-- REMINDERS -->

- div does not exist in react-native, remember this when you use rafce // use rnf instead
- onclick is onpress for rn
- for target blank hrefs, you use Linking.openUrl(url) and for routes within, you use router.push(route)
- in onchange functions in rn, you immediately get the value of the change event ; instead of (e) => e.target.value, it becomes (value) => value
- onchange function isn't appropriate for react native textinput tag , it's onchangetext
- router.push takes you to a new page
- read on usecallback function react again
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components#core-components
- https://reactnative.dev/docs/ (VERY IMPORTANT)
- In react native, button are self closing tags and receive props such as title, onPress, etc. but they do not take in style prop
- Go to the api reference for a particular rn tag to see more information about the props you can use and how they work. Good advice.

### DOCUMENTATION FOR ERRORS ENCOUNTERED SO FAR AND HOW THEY WERE FIXED

<!-- DOCUMENTATION FOR ERRORS ENCOUNTERED SO FAR AND HOW THEY WERE FIXED -->

a. Unmatched route : Fix - Didn't have a default export on homepage. // You removed react-native-unimodules.
b. Error while updating property showVerticalScrollIndicator : You put the value (false/true) in strings instead of boolean.
c. uri can't cast : you used src instead of src
d. renderItem (most occured in) forgetting to destructure, passing a value like a normal function {({})=>()} remember
e. In FlatList, item must be destructure (({})) not (())
f. BLANK PAGE (WHITE PAGE) because of flex:1

### BUILD

<!-- BUILD -->

- stop server from running
- npm install -g expo cli (we don't need it)
- npm install -g eas-cli
- npx expo install expo-dev-client
- eas login
- eas build --profile development --platform android
- eas build --profile development --platform ios (in progress)

### FOR DEPLOYMENT

<!-- FOR DEPLOYMENT -->

- eas build --platform android/ios
- eas build --platform all
